An Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits. In other words, a number is Armstrong if the sum of its digitsâ€™ nth powers equals the number itself.

Example: 153 is an Armstrong number because:

1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153
